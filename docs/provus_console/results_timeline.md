The results timeline widget of the Provus console provides the user with the ability to scrub through all previous simulations for a given data profile and restore the active project to the state it was in at the time that the chosen simulation was successfully completed. This functionality is useful for the case where project conductors have undergone many changes over the course of modelling and the user wishes to restore them to a previous state in which the fit to the observed data was better.

To bring up the results timeline the user must first select a data profile for which to view the simulation timeline, this is done using the checkbox to the left of the list of profile names. Once the data profile(s) have been selected pressing the "Plot Timeline" button will generate a new plotting window with a sliding widget above the plots which the user may drag back and forth to view previous simulation results. An example of this user interface is shown below.

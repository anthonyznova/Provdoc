# Geology

If the user chooses, they can import drillhole data and geologic surfaces from a geoh5 file. When successfully imported, the surfaces will be populated in the world tree and the drill hole data will be populated within an object called "Geology" which will be present in the world tree.

## Importing / Creating

To import geology data from a Geoscience Analyst workspace, the user will navigate to the GA-Link tab of the Provus console and select "Import Geology" they will then be prompted to provide a path to a specific geoh5 file from which provus will import all geologic surfaces and drillholes in the workspace. Once imported, any drillholes and geologic surfaces that were imported will be populated in the viewport and in the world tree.

## Object specific dialogue

The user can access the geology object dialog by selecting a drillhole in the viewport or by double clicking "Geology" in the world tree. The dialog window is shown below, from this window the user will determine which drillhole attributes are to be painted and on which holes. Above the paint and thickness channel options are is a histogram for the selected hole showing the distibution and count for the selected attribute.

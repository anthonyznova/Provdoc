The Additional objects folder in the Provus directory is where the user would place any additionaly xyz files that they would like to be imported and displayed in the Provus viewport. For example, if the user had xyz files for geologic layers that they would like to be displayed in the viewport the files can be placed in the Additional objects directory where they will be imported to the active project.

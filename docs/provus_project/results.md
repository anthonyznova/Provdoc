The Simulation results folder contains a detailed history of all simulation results that have been performed for the active Provus project. Upon successful completetion of a simulation Provus will create a .TEM file containing the calculated response and place it in the simulation results folder. This allows the user to go back in time and retrieve the calculated response for any past simulations.
